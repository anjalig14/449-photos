        Roses are commonly gifted to loved ones as a form of affection. <br> 
        Roses symbolize love and romance but each color can have its own <br>
        meaning. Red roses symbolize romance and true love while pink roses <br>
        show gratitude and admiration. Yellow roses symbolize friendship and <br>
        white mean purity, youthfulness, and innocence. It is truly beautiful <br>
        the way that we try to find beautiful meanings to convey through flowers.
